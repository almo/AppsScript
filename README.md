# AppsScript
## Introduction
[Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) is a 
Cloud based platform allowing developers to integrate with [Google 
products](https://about.google/products). 


Currently supporting [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) 
and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), Apps Script can be
developed using an [online editor](https://script.google.com/) or 
locally using [clasp](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp), 
a command line interface. 

This second option enables developers to use version 
control systems, such as [git](https://git-scm.com/), 
easing collaboration and the distribution through 
online services such as [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## No Code for Everybody
Thanks to the variety of Google products, Apps Scripts applications are particularly powerful, significantly improving the developer productivity. These applications are specially convenient for efficient technical staff and product managers seeking fast prototyping solutions. 

Actually, students, newbies or non technical professionals might excel like pro thanks scripting alike programming paradigm. This repo contains some libraries and applications that I developed for personal use.
